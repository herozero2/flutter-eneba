## Current Status

The app is almost ready to run! The only remaining issue is that we need proper PNG launcher icons instead of placeholder text files.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use Flutter's Built-in Icon Generator

Run this command to generate proper launcher icons:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

But first, add this to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: "^0.13.1"

flutter_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/icon.png"
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix (Recommended)

1. **Download any simple icon from the web:**
   - Search for "flutter icon png" or "ecommerce icon png"
   - Download a simple 512x512 PNG image

2. **Replace the placeholder files:**
   - Copy your downloaded PNG to all mipmap folders with the name `ic_launcher.png`
   - Or use an online tool to generate different sizes

### Option 3: Use the Provided Script

If you have ImageMagick installed:
```bash
chmod +x create_launcher_icons.sh
./create_launcher_icons.sh
```

### Option 4: Skip for Now (Build Anyway)

You can also build without proper icons by removing the icon references from `AndroidManifest.xml` temporarily.

## After Fixing Icons

1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Clean and rebuild:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## Alternative: Use Web Platform

If you just want to test the app quickly, run it on web:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

The web platform doesn't require Android launcher icons.
