## If You Still Get XML Error

If you're still getting the XML error, it means your local file has encoding issues. Here's the nuclear option:

1. **Delete the problematic file:**
   ```bash
   rm android/app/src/main/res/drawable/launch_background.xml
   ```

2. **Download the clean version from GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/herozero2/flutter-eneba/blob/main/launch_background_clean.xml
   - Download the file
   - Place it in `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/launch_background.xml`

3. **Or use this PowerShell command:**
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item "android\app\src\main\res\drawable\launch_background.xml" -Force
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/herozero2/flutter-eneba/main/launch_background_clean.xml" -OutFile "android\app\src\main\res\drawable\launch_background.xml"
   ```
